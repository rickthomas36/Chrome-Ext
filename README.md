Here I have followed a few guides to help me understand what is needed to create my own Chrome ext.

The first thing to note that before it can be launched is that you will need a manifest.json file

You can easily create one and this will allow you to add it once you apply it to the developer settings in Google Chrome

The second will depend on what you want from you Chrome extension. Since I made one that only showed upcoming concert event in my area, I had to use an API 
that I sourced from a website called Rapid API. Then all that was left to do was set the parameters for the City and date range while using "by Location" as my end point.
